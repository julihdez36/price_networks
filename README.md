# Semiparametric Approaches for Inferring Topological Properties in Complex Price Networks

## Research summary
 
The problem of estimating the price structure in an economy through a high-dimensional undirected network is considered. To model the dependency relationships between prices, Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) are employed, which define a graph \( G = (V, E) \), where the set of edges \( E \) describes \textit{conditional dependency} relationships between pairs of vertices \( (i, j) \in V^{2} \). Since GGMs rely on the assumption of joint normality, which is not satisfied by price series, a semiparametric extension based on the use of Gaussian copulas, known as the \textit{nonparanormal distribution} \citep{liu2009nonparanormal}, is adopted. To address the high dimensionality and achieve \textit{sparse} inference, the Graphical Lasso estimation algorithm (\textit{GLasso}) is used. The methodology is applied to a dataset of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), covering the period 2012-2023. The implementation is carried out in the R software, utilizing the \textit{igraph} and \textit{huge} packages.
